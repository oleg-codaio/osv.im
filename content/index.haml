  My name is Oleg. Born in Ukraine, I've lived most of my life in the Bay State.

  I'm currently a Computer Engineering undergrad at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), interested in mobile and embedded systems, among other things. I'm also minoring in Music Performance and (surprise!) Computer Science.

  When I'm not busy with schoolwork, side projects, or research, I tend to enjoy sleeping, browsing [cat pictures](http://i.imgur.com/L7lTalw.gif) on reddit, and hitting up the gym.
