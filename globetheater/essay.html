       The Globe Theater <br>
    </P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	“The whole world is a stage,” was the motto of the Globe
Theater. The Globe Theater was a great architectural feat. Built and
rebuilt three times, it lied near the Thames River in London. The
Globe Theater had a great history. It is also very unique in its way,
and most importantly, it was where Shakespeare had his plays
performed. The Globe was important to the history of architecture,
plays, and civilization. At first, the Theater had a past unlike any
other buildings in the world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	The first and original Globe Theater was built in 1599 to
accommodate the famous Shakespearian plays. Its timber was used from
The Theatre, a theater built in Shoreditch. But after 14 years,
during a celebration of the arrival of King Henry IIX, a canon
malfunctioned and hit the Globe Theater, igniting it and wrecking the
beautiful building. The building wasn't fireproof, and its wooden
frame didn't stand a chance against fire. It was rebuilt in 1614,
this time with tiles instead of a flammable roof. After a while, it
got closed down by the Puritans. After a long time, the Globe was
finally rebuilt by Her Majesty The Queen, and in August, 1997, the
doors opened. This new Globe Theater was almost an exact duplicate,
as not much information on the original Globe existed anymore. The
Globe shared the Elizabethan architectural style with the previous
versions of the Globe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	The original Globe was presumably an 18- or 20-sided amphitheater
with a crown-like roof and 3 floors of seating galleries. The Globe,
from one side to the other, measured around 100 feet, and could
contain 3000 spectators. In the middle of the Globe, peasants could
pay a penny to stand there, because the couldn't afford to be in the
seats. The galleries cost 2 pence, and the Lord's Room cost at least
5 pence. There, the rich people could show off even though the view
from there wasn't as great as from the front. The stage was a
rectangular platform which was 5 feet high. There was a floor trap
and a heavens trap, and there was also a balcony in which either
musicians would perform or actors would perform for some scenes. When
the new Globe was built by McCurdy &amp; Co. Ltd with the design of
Pentagram in 1997, the theater was made to be as much of a replica as
possible. Although it was the same, the theater only housed 1300
people instead of 3000 due to health and safety regulations. Luckily
more people could see Shakespeare's plays when he performed them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	When Shakespeare performed there, the actors had to do their own
stunts, such as jumping, falling, and so on. They also had to wield
different weapons like they've used them all life. They had to yell
so people would hear them, and it wouldn't be that easy with so many
people there. For effects such as blood, the actors would fill up
vessels like pigs' bladders with liquid or real blood, and during the
right time, empty or pop them out. For audio effects, there would
usually be a group of musicians on the balcony performing for the
play. The costumes Shakespeare used were actually modern, so at the
time they weren't unusual.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
	There is not a large amount of information about the Globe theater,
Shakespeare, and the era in which they lived in. Although some
primary sources got wiped out due to age, there are others as well.
The Globe was really important to the history of architecture, plays,
and civilization. In fact, during  the time of Shakespeare, plays
were the best form of entertainment and everyone would attend them.
The Globe was one of the most famous theaters. In conclusion, the
Globe theater was a very important building that shaped the history
of the performances of plays.</P>
